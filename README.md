# User-Story 
- Students pursuing dentistry in Palestinian universities are mandated to encounter genuine cases and treat patients proficiently in order to successfully pass their academic assessments and graduate. The process of finding suitable patients for such purposes can be arduous, with some days passing without any patients while other days become overly busy and challenging to manage. To mitigate this issue, we have developed an application that serves to simplify the process for both patients and doctors alike.

# Usage
- git clone `https://github.com/GSG-G13/WEEK6-FARAH-ALBATTRAWI.git`
- Start the server: npm start
- Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
- Fill the form and wait for the university clinic to contact u

# Technologies-Used
- .HTML, CSS, and JavaScript . 
- .Node Js and Express .
